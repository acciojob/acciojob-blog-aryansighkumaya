<p><a href=>We can say that optimization is one step further than the brute force method of problem solving and it is the most important branch of the algorithm based on that the algorithm runs efficient.Optimization is defined by the time complexity of the algorithm</a></p>

	<a href=>DSA vs. Competitive Programming</a>
<p><a href="">DSA or Competitive programming Data Structures and Algorithms is a vast ocean. If you are thinking that you will complete it and then begin competitive coding,trust me it will never be possible.The fact that CP involves the application of DSA how can you think you will do CP without first learning at least the basics of DSA?
		Both DSA and CP go hand in hand. The best way for a beginner is to study well a data structure and then go for questions based on it. Platforms like Hackerrank, Hackerearth offer you this thing. Once you have a strong hold on these ,you can go for a mixed bag of Questions. After this ,you can participate</a></p>
